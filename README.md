# grpc-java
This is a simple code that implements the usage of the **gRPC** and the **prototype buffers**  and I will be implementing the usage of the *stream* response provided by the server. For further information on gRPC please visit  [link to protobuf!](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)

# Made so far:
- [x] proto buffer made with Gradle
- [x] single protobuf usage
- [ ] streaming protobuf usage
